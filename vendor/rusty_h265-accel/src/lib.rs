//! SIMD kernels for [`rusty_h265`](https://crates.io/crates/rusty_h265).
//!
//! The decoder core is `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`; this crate is the seam where
//! acceleration is allowed to use `unsafe`, and it is confined to
//! `#[target_feature]` functions whose bounds the safe dispatcher proves.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! Every kernel comes in a set:
//!
//! - `*_scalar` — plain safe Rust. **The oracle and the fallback**, compiled on
//!   every target, and the only implementation when the `simd` feature is off.
//! - `*_sse2` / `*_avx2` (x86_64), `*_neon` (aarch64) — the twins. SSE2 and
//!   NEON are *baseline* on their architectures, so they need no runtime
//!   detection and no second code path production might never run; AVX2 is
//!   detected once and cached.
//! - a safe `pub fn` dispatcher that picks one and documents why the pointer
//!   arithmetic inside is in bounds.
//!
//! Every kernel is integer and exact: the SIMD twin performs the same
//! operations in the same order as the scalar one, so the gate is
//! `assert_eq!`, not a tolerance. `*_matches_scalar` tests pin that.
//!
//! # Where the dispatch sits
//!
//! A `#[target_feature]` function cannot be inlined into a caller that lacks
//! the feature, so the call is real. Every entry point here therefore takes a
//! whole **block** (a prediction unit, a transform block, a CTB row of SAO) —
//! the loop lives inside the feature boundary, never outside it.
