//! Intra prediction kernels (§8.4.4.2.5–8.4.4.2.6): angular, planar and the
//! DC fill.
//!
//! # Why the compiler cannot do these
//!
//! `intra::predict` compiles to ~1000 instructions containing **17 SIMD-register
//! instructions, every one of them a `movups` or `xorps`** — not one packed
//! arithmetic op. Three separate reasons, one per shape:
//!
//! - **Angular, modes below 18.** The main reference is the left column, so the
//!   inner loop walks `y` and stores to `out[y * stride + x]` — a scatter. LLVM
//!   will not vectorise a strided store here. We compute row-major into scratch
//!   and transpose in 8×8 tiles instead, which is 24 unpacks per 64 samples.
//! - **Angular, modes 18 and up.** Loads and stores are contiguous, but the
//!   arithmetic is `i32` because nothing tells the compiler the samples fit
//!   `i16`. The spec does: Main and Main 10 samples are at most 1023, and the
//!   two weights sum to 32, so `(32 − f)·a + f·b ≤ 32 · 1023 = 32,736`. That is
//!   exactly one `pmaddwd` — the same two-tap contraction the MC kernels use.
//! - **Planar and DC.** Both shift by `log2n + 1`, a **variable** shift amount,
//!   which LLVM's cost model treats as a vectorisation blocker.
//!
//! # The bound that makes `i16` legal
//!
//! Every kernel here takes samples already narrowed to `i16`. That is sound for
//! HEVC version 1 (Main, Main 10: `BitDepth ≤ 10`, so a sample is at most 1023)
//! and the debug assertions check it. A future range extension profile with 12+
//! bit samples must take the scalar twin — [`angular`] and friends fall back on
//! their own bounds checks rather than trusting the caller.
