//! Sample-domain kernels: writing a prediction out of the 14-bit intermediate
//! (§8.5.3.3.4.2 default weighted prediction) and adding a residual into the
//! picture (§8.6.6).
//!
//! # Why saturating adds are exact here
//!
//! Both write-out paths end in the mandatory clip to `[0, maxVal]`, and
//! `maxVal` is at most 1023. Whenever a saturating `i16` add would clamp at
//! ±32767, the exact `i32` result — shifted right by 5, 6 or 7 — is already
//! outside `[0, maxVal]` and the clip produces the same sample. So the kernels
//! stay in `i16` lanes end to end, with no widening, and still match the
//! scalar twin bit for bit. The `*_matches_scalar` tests sweep the saturation
//! boundary deliberately, not just typical values.
